# BBART (Development Version)

This repository contains all code necessary to replicate analysis in the paper
"Functional Variable Selection using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
with Basis-Expanded Functional Covariates"[title changed from Functional Bayesian 
Additive Regression Trees] (Marvald, Love, and Groves, 2025). The
analysis_files folder contains the data and R script to run the analysis and the necessary
functions to do so are contained in the R folder.

Data comes from a Center for Medical Countermeasures Against Radiation Center funded
project to develop radiation exposure biomarkers and diagnostics.
