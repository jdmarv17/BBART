# BBART (Development Version)

This repository contains all code necessary to replicate analysis in the papers
"Bayesian Additive Regression Trees with Basis-Expanded
Functional Covariates"[title changed from Functional Bayesian 
Additive Regression Trees] (Marvald, Love, and Groves, 2025) and "Functional
Variable Selection using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees with Basis-Expanded Functional Covariates" 
(Marvald, Love, and Groves, 2025). The analysis_files folder contains the data and R scripts to run the
analyses and the necessary functions are contained in the R folder. 
'mice_irradiation_analysis' and 'mice_variable_selection' correspond to the analyses from 
each paper respectively.

Data comes from a Center for Medical Countermeasures Against Radiation Center funded
project to develop radiation exposure biomarkers and diagnostics.
