#' Function to return a vector of indicators
#'
#' @param var_indices A vector of integers specifying position of 1's in the output vector- largest value no greater than p.
#' @param p Length of output indicator vector
#'
#' @return A vector of 1's and 0's. 1's are in positions specified by var_indices.
